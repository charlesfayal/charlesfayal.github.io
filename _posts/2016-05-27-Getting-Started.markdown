I built this site using a course through Codeacademy called "Deploy a Website". The course was incredibly quick and here's what I got! 
I look forward to expanding on this site and eventually hosting it myself, possibly through my own server.
{% include image.html
            img="images/myimage.jpg"
            title="title for image"
            caption="caption for image"
            url="http://example.com" %}
