I built this site using a course through Codeacademy called "Deploy a Website". The course was incredibly quick and here's what I got! 
I look forward to expanding on this site and eventually hosting it myself, possibly through my own server.
{% include image.html
            img="/images/Linkedinphoto.jpg"
            title="Charles"
            caption="My personal website!"
            url="http://charlesfayal.com" %}
