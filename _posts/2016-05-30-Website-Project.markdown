I am using this website as a way to motivate and teach myself HTML,CSS, and various other languages. I also plan on using this page as a way to post projects that I am working on. 
I started this website using a jekyll template and I am branching off and building my own pages from it. Jekyll is a great way to create a base template from and it has a great community to learn from. 

{% include image.html
            img="charlesfayal.github.io/images/Linkedinphoto.jpg"
            title="Charles"
            caption="My personal website!"
            url="http://charlesfayal.com" %}
