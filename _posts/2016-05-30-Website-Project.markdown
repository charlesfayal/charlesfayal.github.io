I am using this website as a way to motivate and teach myself HTML,CSS, and various other languages.

{% include image.html
            img="charlesfayal.github.io/images/Linkedinphoto.jpg"
            title="Charles"
            caption="My personal website!"
            url="http://charlesfayal.com" %}
