  This is my personal website project. I am using this website as a way to learn a number of skills.
  I am hoping to learn more about coding, website development, databases etc.

  #Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this

  #Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.
baseurl: "/about" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
